- After trial ends: account **reverts to Free** unless upgraded.

## Notes / guardrails
- Pricing is designed so add-on seats for Pro/Pro+ do **not** undercut the value of upgrading to Team.
- **Curated groups / share links** are the shareable “group pages” a Real Estate Pro creates and labels (e.g., `/u/<username>`, `/u/<username>/spanish`, etc.). Higher tiers unlock more share links.

## Glossary (important)
- **Journey**: a specific client’s buying/selling process (remaining steps + the pros referred + status updates).
- **Curated group (share link)**: a labeled set of recommended pros that the Real Estate Pro shares to a specific lead/client.
