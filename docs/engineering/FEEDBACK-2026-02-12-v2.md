# Frank's Feedback v2 — 2026-02-12 (post search bar ship)

## Homepage Improvements Required

### 1) Search Bar UX (Critical)
- Search bar is too long — users shouldn't have to reach for the search button
- **When clicked: show clickable service bubbles** (Realtor, Lender, Attorney, Home Inspector, Insurance Agent) + an "All" bubble
- Users can click ONE or MULTIPLE bubbles, then hit Search
- This solves the problem of users misspelling or not knowing what to type
- The animated typewriter placeholder can stay, but the interaction model changes to bubble selection
- A squared/rectangle dropdown opens on click — needs to be a clean bubble/chip selector instead

### 2) Remove redundant "Browse Marketplace" button
- Now that we have the search bar, the "Browse Marketplace" button directly below it is redundant — remove it

### 3) Reposition "I'm a Real Estate Pro" CTA
- Should NOT be a button in the hero next to Browse Marketplace
- Needs its own dedicated section that clearly communicates:
  - It's FREE to list their business
  - They can link their existing profile (since we'll pull from Google Places)
  - Value prop for pros: get found, receive referrals, manage their Relays presence

### 4) Fix messaging — NOT a tracker/booking system
- Relays is NOT a "track progress" or "book and track" system
- It IS: a **reminder of what's the next professional needed** so users can complete their buying or selling journey
- Remove all "track progress", "book & track" language
- Replace with: find the next pro you need, get reminders of what's left in your journey

### 5) Not just for buyers — ALSO for sellers
- Current messaging makes it seem buyer-only
- Relays is for both BUYERS and SELLERS building their team
- Update all copy to reflect buying OR selling journey

### 6) Clarify what Relays actually does (3 user paths)
- **Path 1:** Search + build your own team (buyer or seller browses marketplace)
- **Path 2:** Already working with a pro? Find them on Relays and add them to your team
- **Path 3:** Get referred by your real estate pro — join via their link, see their curated referrals, be attached to their team

### 7) Design quality
- Keep the subtle AI aesthetic touches — Frank likes them
- Push design to the highest level possible
- More engaging, more polished, more unique

## Wave 3 (Ship after homepage fixes)
- Google Places API integration (pre-populate marketplace)
- Admin/CMS dashboard (metrics, verification queue, category management, employee management)
