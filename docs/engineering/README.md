# Engineering Docs (Start Here)

## Architecture
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — current architecture decisions + folder structure + route map
- `ARCHITECTURE-OPUS.md` — architecture proposal generated via Claude Opus (for comparison)

## Plans
- `BUILD-CHECKLIST.md` — ordered build plan (strict)

## Conventions
- Keep changes scoped to the current phase.
- Align UI to `../sources/RELAYS-DESIGN-HARD-RULES.md` and `../design/*`.
