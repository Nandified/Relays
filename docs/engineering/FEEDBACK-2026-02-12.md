# Frank's Feedback — 2026-02-12

## Captured from Telegram (complete)

### 1) Google Places pre-population (growth hack)
- Supplement marketplace with Google Places API results
- Platform looks full from day 1
- When consumer interacts with a Google-sourced pro → send email to that business's Google listing email
- Email: "Clients are viewing your profile on Relays. Sign up to see who's looking."
- Pro acquisition loop

### 2) Pro onboarding is broken
- Currently auto-assigns Home Inspector — no selection
- Needs proper flow: pick service category, company name, service area, headshot/logo upload
- Optional: license for verification

### 3) Verified badge = license upload (auto-verified)
- Pro uploads license (image/PDF) → automated verification → badge granted instantly
- **No manual admin review in the normal flow** — automation handles it
- Verification engine (OCR-based):
  1. Extract text from uploaded document
  2. Check: looks like an official license/credential?
  3. Check: name on document matches pro's profile name?
  4. Check: license number present?
  5. Check: expiration date valid (if visible)?
  6. All pass → auto-verified, badge granted immediately
  7. Fails or low confidence → flagged for manual admin review
- **Universal** — no state-specific logic. Works for any state's licensing board
- Badge is the incentive — pros look more legit, so they're motivated to upload
- Post-approval: consumers/pros can report suspicious badges → triggers manual review
- Admin dashboard shows all verifications for optional spot-checking

### 4) Pro profile layout
- Video ABOVE the "About me" description

### 5) Remove categories (for now)
- Remove: Handyman, Contractor, Title Company
- Keep: Realtor, Lender, Attorney, Home Inspector, Insurance
- Admin/employee ability to create new service categories later

### 6) Property association
- Users must be able to add a property they're transacting on
- Journey is tied to a property

### 7) NOT a task/deadline manager
- Relays is NOT another CMS/email/deadline tracker for pros
- Pros already deal with too many tools
- Relays = checklist of what's needed, NOT workload management
- No deadline tracking on attorney notifications etc.

### 8) Journey flow (THE core product)
- Journey created by Realtor or Lender → sent to client
- Client sees panel of 3 recommended pros per service category
- If a role is already filled (e.g., the Realtor who created it), that role shows ONLY that pro (no alternatives)
- Categories in journey: Lender (3), Attorney (3), Home Inspector (3), Insurance (3)
- The visibility/presentation of this must be unique, modern, thoroughly designed

### 9) Dark mode (DEFAULT)
- Dark mode as default theme
- Modern, slightly AI-ish aesthetic (subtle, not ChatGPT wrapper)
- Current design feels generic — needs visual identity

### 10) Admin/CMS dashboard
- Internal Relays team login
- Metrics tracking (signups, leads, bookings, requests)
- Support/issues handling
- License verification queue (approve → verified badge)
- Employee management
- Ability to create new service pro categories
