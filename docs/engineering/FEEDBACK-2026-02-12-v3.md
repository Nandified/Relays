# Frank's Feedback v3 — 2026-02-12 (Marketplace + Search UX Overhaul)

## Source: Telegram screenshots + Homes.com reference

### 1. Search Bar UX (Both Homepage + Marketplace)
- Search should work in MULTIPLE ways simultaneously:
  - Select category pills/chips
  - Type an **Agent Name** to find a specific person
  - Type a **Company Name** to find a company
  - Type a **Type of Professional** (e.g., "realtor", "attorney")
  - Zip code for location
- Reference: Homes.com — "Place, Neighborhood, Agent Name, School or Company"
- Live autocomplete suggestions as user types (like Homes.com dropdown)
- Suggestions should show: Recently viewed, matching pros, matching companies
- Connected to Google Places for results not in our system

### 2. Homepage → Marketplace Selection Transfer
- When user selects categories/pills on homepage and searches, those selections should properly transfer to the marketplace page
- Currently not working correctly

### 3. Marketplace Page Redesign
- Current layout issues:
  - Filter chips/tabs need to be "more breakable down further" — more granular filtering
  - Side preview panel on desktop is OK but...
  - **MOBILE: Side panel shows at the bottom and takes forever to scroll to**
  - Need a better mobile UX

### 4. Mobile Card Expansion (Critical UX Fix)
- **Instead of a separate preview panel on mobile**, clicking a pro card should **expand inline** to show the full profile details
- The card itself opens/expands with the detailed info (accordion style)
- No need to scroll to a separate section at the bottom
- This is cleaner and more intuitive on mobile

### 5. Marketplace Search Bar Improvements
- Current marketplace search says "What service do you need?" — too limited
- Should support: Agent Name, Company, or Type of Professional
- Placeholder: "Search by name, company, or profession..."
- Should have the same zip code integration as homepage

### 6. Google Places Integration in Search
- Both search bars connected to Google Places
- If we don't have that professional → Google Places results still appear
- Unclaimed profiles can be invited or company can be claimed
- Already being built by sub-agent — just ensuring it extends to both search bars
